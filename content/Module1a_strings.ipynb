    "\n",
    "The information stored in a computer is collectively referred to as data. Data can be expressed in many different ways, which we refer to as ‚Äútypes‚Äù. Each type looks different and has different rules governing its usage.\n",

    "At the most basic level, computers store data in binary form.\n",

    "However, this level of data is difficult to read and even harder to program in. Instead, programmers use more abstract forms of data represented in English when reading and writing code. These abstract instructions are then converted into binary by our coding software, which the computer can execute.\n",

    "### What is a string?\n",
    "\n",
    "A string is a type of data that looks and reads like plain english. Each string contains a collection of characters that can be made up of letters, numbers, and/or punctuation.\n",
