Data can be expressed in many different ways, which we refer to as ‚Äútypes‚Äù. Each type looks different and has different rules governing its usage.\n\nAt the most basic level, computers store data in binary form.\n\n![Classic 1s and 0s you might have seen in movies.](Strings%20664be8b8c9644313881e15ee14f1c07a/Screen_Shot_2022-05-16_at_4.18.09_PM.png)\n\nClassic 1s and 0s you might have seen in movies.\n\nHowever, this level of data is difficult to read and even harder to program in. Instead, programmers use more abstract forms of data represented in English when reading and writing code. These abstract instructions are then converted into binary by our coding software, which the computer can execute.\n\n# New Data Type: `String`\n\n### Intro - how to make a computer speak English\n\n![YaleNews_hopper-grace.UNIVAC.102635875-CC_0.jpg](Strings%20664be8b8c9644313881e15ee14f1c07a/YaleNews_hopper-grace.UNIVAC.102635875-CC_0.jpg)\n\n> ‚ÄúThey told me computers could only do arithmetic‚Ä¶So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code‚Äù - Grace Hopper\n> \n\n### What is a string?\n\nA string is a type of data that looks and reads like plain english. Each string contains a collection of characters that can be made up of letters, numbers, and/or punctuation. \n\n![Can you figure out how many characters are in this string?](Strings%20664be8b8c9644313881e15ee14f1c07a/Untitled.png)\n\nCan you figure out how many characters are in this string?\n\n### Strings in Python\n\nIn Python, and many other programming languages, strings are enclosed by either single or double quotes. The following are both valid strings.",
